# Chicago-Vision-Zero
Data journalism of Chicago City data on car crashes
The City of Chicago made the data on car crashes publicly available in a commitment to reach Vision Zero - a project which aims to eliminate fatal and inncapacitating accidents on the roads of the city.
I felt inspired to look into the data while thinking back to the times spent in Chicago traffic while on a documentary film shoot for Nobel perspectives where we talked to Bob Lucas and Lars Peter Hanson as well as their families, friends and colleagues. We stood in traffic at times for longer than the trip took us. I only felt as if the congestions are adding to the problems but at the time I did not know much about the deadly crashes and whay might be done.
For this project I downloaded the crashes dataset, limited it to the city-wide data from October 2017. I then treated, cleaned and prepared it for the analysis.
The questions I asked: 
1) What behaviours are associated with the mortality and serious injuries on the roads? 
2) What structural conditions can be changed or improved in order to bring the deaths and serious injuries down to zero?

My analysis of behavioural factors suggests that 
1. pedestrians are the most common participant in a deadly car crashes (ca. a quarter of the cases with grave to fatal injuries)
2. roughly a third of the total number of fatal and incapacitating crashes occured at a traffic signal
3. among the most common primary causes of the crash as determined by the police officer, (after unable to determine - in a third of the cases) failure to yeld right of the way, failure to reduce speed and disregarding the signs are the most common ones (together a third of casuses)
4. the number of crashes (both fatal and not) is almost double the amount during the rush hours first around 8am and then between 3pm and 6pm, confirming the guess that more traffic leads to more accidents
5. In terms of the days of the week, the deadliest crashes tend to happen on the weekends, between Fridays and Sundays
6. Location wise, the fatal crashes occur throughout the city, with some concentration in the downtown area and some of the south Chicago neighbourhoods.
